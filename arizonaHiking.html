<p>4. Parts of Downtown Were Built Over 3,000-Year-Old Ruins built by the Hohokam native american people.</p>
<p>3. Phoenix Is the Most-Populated State Capital in the country… At almost 1.5 million people, Phoenix is much larger than the second-biggest capital, Indianapolis, which is home to about 850,000 people.</p>
<p>2. Only 40 Percent of Phoenix Residents Were Born in Arizona… Beyond that, most suburbs of Phoenix have even lower rates of Arizona-born people.</p>
